# Flappy Bird Game<br/>
<br/>
This is a simple implementation of the classic Flappy Bird game using Python and Pygame. I drew the game assets myself using Aseprite.<br/>
<br/>
## How to Play<br/>
<br/>
- Press the space bar to make the bird jump.<br/>
- Avoid the pipes by flying between them.<br/>
- Each successful pass through a pair of pipes earns you one point.<br/>
- If the bird collides with a pipe or hits the ground or ceiling, the game ends.<br/>
